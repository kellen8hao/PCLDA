# PCLDA

PCLDA, a pipeline composed of three modules: t-test-based gene screening, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), all built on
simple statistical methods.

- **Data**

For user convenience, I have included an example dataset in the dataset folder, which can be directly used with the provided code. In the supplementary_table.xlsx file, I have included information about all the datasets used in my paper. Users can download these datasets using the GEO or EBI numbers provided

- **Code**
The full implementation of PCLDA, including all preprocessing scripts and benchmarking pipelines, is provided in the repository. To run the pipeline on your own dataset or the included example:
